/* DIE Model

distributed: Are systems distributed to allow for scalability while preventing dependence on a single zone?
immutable: Can the infrastructure be disposed of and replaced in the event of an issue, aka infrastructure as code?
ephemeral: Whatâ€™s the period for system reprovisioning, and are assets disposable in the event of a breach?
